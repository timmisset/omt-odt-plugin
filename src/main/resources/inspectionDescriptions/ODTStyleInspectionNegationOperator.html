<p>Inspects usage of collection operators EMPTY and EXISTS in combination with the NOT operator</p>
Operators EMPTY and EXISTS are often used in combination with the NOT operator which is not necessary.<br>
In general, it is good practice to use positive assertions over negative assertions because it makes the code
more readable.<br>
For example:<br>
IF $value / NOT EMPTY { } ==> IF $value / EXISTS {}<br>
<br>
Three scenarios for unnecessary negation are detected:<br>
Leading negation: $value / NOT EMPTY<br>
Inside negation: NOT($value / EMPTY)<br>
Trailing negation: $value / EMPTY / NOT<br>
<br>
For all three scenarios, a quickfix is available to replace the negative assertion with a positive assertion<br>
