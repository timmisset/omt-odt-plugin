Detects unused import members which are imported into the OMT File but not used anywhere.<br>
The detection mechanism uses reference resolving, meaning that if import member and at least one reference
in the same file resolve to the same target the validation is passed.<br><br>
If something in the OMT file refers to the imported member but is not properly placed or recognized as
a reference position, the validation will fail.<br>
