Introduce a new variable declaration for the ODT statement. It will resolve the statement
to a type and use that type as either the primitive name (string, integer) or the localName
part from a result ontology type.</br>
</br>
After creating the variable, you can trigger refactor-rename (shift F6) to show a list with
names that might also be what you want. These contain method call names (or part thereof)
