This means the payload\nproperty is going to 'listen' for changes in that query. It does a shallow compare and does not check for changes within the objects.\nFor example, when the payload property is based on a query with employees, the `onChange` will be invoked when the query returns\nmore or less employees, but it will not fire when the name of one of the existing employees changes.\n\nThe `onChange` script is executed with two additional variables: `$oldValue` and `$newValue`. Those contain the previous and the\ncurrent value of the ODT query result.\n"
